## Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)

### CRO Fundamentals

Conversion Rate Optimization is the systematic process of increasing the percentage of website visitors who complete desired actions. It combines data analysis, user psychology, and testing methodologies to improve business outcomes while enhancing user experience.

5. **Evaluation**: Visitor compares final options and reviews details
6. **Purchase**: Visitor completes the desired conversion action

**Funnel Metrics:**

- **Traffic Volume**: Number of visitors entering each funnel stage

- **Conversion Rate**: Percentage advancing from one stage to the next

- **Drop-off Points**: Stages where visitors most commonly exit

- **Time in Stage**: Duration visitors spend in each funnel stage
